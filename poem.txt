People never learn,
As men sleep their seething minds churn.
Mad mad mad with power we go
 Build our towers higher

And we will one day conquer the skies.
 The gods are displeased

and strike them down with their power
yet we are strong.

Rebuilding wonâ€™t take that long,
that is what we thought until
the day had come.

The gods came down from their throne,
And destroy our home.

But we stand strong,
and will fight to the end.
We had our minds twisted
our hearts bent,
but humanity survived.
